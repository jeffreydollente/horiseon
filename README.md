# Code Refactor Starter Code
Title of this website is Horiseon
This project had was a good starter to cleaning up the CCS style by combining styles that are identical.
The first link "Search Engine Optimization" had to be linked to its designated source and had to add alt descriptions for each image.
Running Tests - After git commit - git push - i would open the html file to the browser with my developer tools open - developer tools helps show the errors with the code and css.
